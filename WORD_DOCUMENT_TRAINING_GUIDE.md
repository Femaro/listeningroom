# Word Document Training Guide

## Overview
The training system now supports uploading Word documents (.docx) in addition to text files (.txt, .md) for creating training modules. This guide explains how to prepare and upload Word documents for optimal results.

## Supported File Formats
- **Text Files**: `.txt`, `.md`
- **Word Documents**: `.docx`
- **Maximum File Size**: 10MB per file
- **Multiple Files**: You can upload multiple files at once

## Preparing Word Documents for Training

### 1. Document Structure
For best results, structure your Word document with clear headings and sections:

#### Use Word's Built-in Heading Styles
- **Heading 1** for main module titles
- **Heading 2** for major sections
- **Heading 3** for subsections
- **Normal** for regular content

#### Example Structure:
```

```

### 2. Content Guidelines

#### Title Detection
The system automatically detects titles from:
- Lines starting with `#` (markdown style)
- Lines containing "Title:" or "Module:"
- Word document headings

#### Description Extraction
Include a description section with:
- "Description:", "Overview:", or "Summary:" keywords
- Brief explanation of what the module covers

#### Level Classification
Specify difficulty level using:
- "Beginner", "Level 1", or "Basic" for entry-level content
- "Intermediate", "Level 2", or "Advanced" for mid-level content
- "Advanced", "Level 3", or "Expert" for advanced content

#### Required Modules
Mark mandatory modules with:
- "Required" or "Mandatory" keywords in the content

### 3. Section Organization

#### Automatic Section Detection
The system automatically creates sections from:
- Word heading styles (Heading 1, 2, 3)
- Markdown-style headers (`##`, `###`)
- Numbered lists (`1.`, `2.`, etc.)

#### Best Practices
- Use consistent heading hierarchy
- Keep sections focused and manageable
- Include clear section titles
- Break long content into digestible chunks

- Extracts headings and subheadings
- Converts to plain text for training display

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### File Not Uploading
- **Check file format**: Ensure file is `.docx` format
- **Check file size**: Keep under 10MB
- **Check file corruption**: Try opening in Word first

#### Poor Section Detection
- **Use Word heading styles**: Apply proper heading formatting
- **Check heading hierarchy**: Use consistent heading levels
- **Avoid complex formatting**: Keep structure simple and clear

#### Content Not Displaying Correctly
- **Check text extraction**: Verify content was extracted properly
- **Review section breaks**: Ensure clear section divisions
- **Test with simple document**: Try with basic Word document first

### Error Messages

#### "Failed to load mammoth library"

- **Alternative**: Use text files (.txt, .md) instead

#### "Please select only supported files"
- **Solution**: Ensure files are .txt, .md, or .docx format
- **Check**: Verify file extensions are correct

#### "Failed to upload modules"
- **Solution**: Check file size and format
- **Alternative**: Try uploading one file at a time

## Best Practices

### Document Preparation
1. **Use Word's built-in styles** for consistent formatting
2. **Keep structure simple** with clear hierarchy
3. **Test with sample content** before uploading large documents
4. **Include clear titles and descriptions** for better organization

### Content Organization
1. **Break content into logical sections** (5-10 sections per module)
2. **Use descriptive section titles** that explain the content
3. **Keep sections focused** on specific topics
4. **Include practical examples** and exercises

### File Management
1. **Use descriptive filenames** that reflect the content
2. **Keep file sizes reasonable** (under 5MB for best performance)
3. **Test uploads** with small files first
4. **Backup original documents** before uploading

## Advanced Features

### Custom Section Types
The system supports different section types:
- **Text sections**: Regular content and explanations
